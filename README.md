# This is now a pre-beta
#### Use it at your own risk, and expect occasional, minor explosions

## Dependencies

`alexandria`, `anaphora`, `cl-fad`, `closer-mop`, `optima`, `local-time`, `fact-base`, `session-token`, `house`

## Usage

### Binary

Download [this](http://static.inaimathi.ca/cl-notebook-binaries/), run it (if you downloaded the tarball instead of the naked binary, unpack it first, obviously)

_At the moment, we've only got binaries for 64-bit Linux. Submissions for other architectures welcome._

### With [`quicklisp`](http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/)

- Install a Common Lisp (I suggest [`sbcl`](http://www.sbcl.org/platform-table.html))
- Install [`quicklisp`](http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/)
- Clone the [`house` server](https://github.com/Inaimathi/house), the [`fact-base` triple-store](https://github.com/Inaimathi/fact-base) and [this repo](https://github.com/Inaimathi/cl-notebook) into your `~quicklisp/local-projects.` directory.
- Hop into a Lisp and do `(ql:quickload :cl-notebook)`, followed by `(cl-notebook:main)`

### With [`roswell`](https://github.com/roswell/roswell) and [`qlot`](https://github.com/fukamachi/qlot)

_These help you manage Common Lisp distributions. They are usefull not only for running cl-notebook, but for any other CL project, so consider them regardless of whether you want this project._

- Install [`roswell`](https://github.com/roswell/roswell)
- Install [`qlot`](https://github.com/fukamachi/qlot)
- Clone [cl-notebook](https://github.com/Inaimathi/cl-notebook)

In the `cl-notebook` directory you cloned to, do:

```
qlot install
qlot exec roswell/cl-notebook.ros --port 4242
```

**Once `cl-notebook` is Running**

Hop into a browser and go to `localhost:4242/` (or whatever port you chose)

A quick-ish, and now slightly out-of-date video demo is available [here](https://vimeo.com/97623064) to get you sort-of-started.

### Building the Binary

#### With [`roswell`](https://github.com/roswell/roswell) and [`qlot`](https://github.com/fukamachi/qlot)

- Install [`roswell`](https://github.com/roswell/roswell)
- Install [`qlot`](https://github.com/fukamachi/qlot)
- Run `qlot exec ros build roswell/cl-notebook.ros` in the `cl-notebook` directory

   That will create a binary with the appropriate name that you can directly run on any machine of your OS and processor architecture.
- Grab your binary at `roswell/cl-notebook`.

This should work under the Linux, OSX and Windows.

#### With [`buildapp`](https://www.xach.com/lisp/buildapp/)

In order to build the `cl-notebook` binary, you need to

- Install a Common Lisp (I suggest, and have only tried this with, [`sbcl`](http://www.sbcl.org/platform-table.html))
- Install [`quicklisp`](http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/)
- Install and build [`buildapp`](https://www.xach.com/lisp/buildapp/)
- Create an appropriate `build.manifest` file for loading `cl-notebook`
- Call `buildapp` with that `build.manifest` file, along with
	- a bunch of `--load-system` calls that include everything `cl-notebook` needs
    - an `--eval` call to `cl-notebook::read-statics` to include all the associated static files along with the binary
    - an `--entry` of `cl-notebook:main`
    - an `--output` of your choice of binary name (I suggest "`cl-notebook`")

That will create a binary with the appropriate name that you can directly run on any machine of your OS and processor architecture.

##### Linux

If you're on a Debian-based linux distro, there is a `build.lisp` and `build.sh` included in the `build/` subdirectory of this repo that do most of the above for you. All you need to do is make sure to install `sbcl`, then call `sh build.sh` in the `build` directory. This will result in a `buildapp` binary and a `cl-notebook` binary being generated for you. The `cl-notebook` binary can then be run on any linux machine _(of the same CPU architecture)_ without worrying about installing a Lisp.

##### OS X

TODO - patches welcome, since I'm not an OS X user

##### Windows

TODO - patches welcome, since I'm not a Windows user

### Source Deployment
### Usage
#### Keybindings
#### Building Programs/Executables
#### Notebook Exporters
#### Cell Compilers

## TODO (also, this section should eventually be moved to the github issue tracker)

- Triage the old bugs (do they still happen? If so; prioritize)
- add a little tutorial to `_notebook` book (or maybe make separate config books)
	- Config books is the right answer I think; we should have a `_welcome`, followed by a bunch of module books (including `charts`, and maybe `minibuffer` at least)
- add a default code cell to each newly created book
- Download the latest `quicklisp.lisp` from `https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp` rather than including one with the binary. We might want to include one too, just as a last resort, but we should try for the more interesting anyway
- Give users an interface to upload new notebooks from their local environments to the notebook instances' local (we need this for the multi-user situation)
- when a cell is clicked, show its control halo (this'll make mobile use possible)
- Add support for more cell types; at minimum `markdown`, and javascript would probably also do nicely
- Need a complete how-to set of videos at some point
- Port to the proper way of using SSEs (with event tags rather than an action field in the payload)
- BUG: When there's an error in a notebook we're loading, we do the "Notebook blah not found" thing. Instead, we should stop evaluating at that point and flag the offending cell. (Alternatively, we could also NOT load a notebook on open, but instead provide an `eval-notebook` function)
	- Had nothing to do with errors in notebook (those do actually get handled properly), this has to do with the approach for the `trurl` notebook, which ended up creating massive numbers of writes (it turns out that our storage approach isn't atomic under heavy enough load :/ This is going to be a deeper issue, and may percipitate the decision about moving to a non-fact-base storage solution)

#### Thoughts
- Charts need to support
	- Being saved to a pure HTML+CSS (no javascript) file
	- Resizing naturally with larger or smaller screen sizes
	- Data sets large enough that not all x-axis labels will fit
	- Print support is a nice-to-have, but conflicts heavily with the previous goal
- SVG can work for charts; CSS selectors work the same way as with regular HTML entities AND it can take % dimensions specifications. We basically have no other options for line/pie/doghnut charts.

- Do we want to provide a straight-up scratch REPL for each user?
	- No I don't think so, but we need additional logging buffers. It would have made debugging "Lemonade Stand" much easier to have a buffer keeping `:house` logging data
- Do we want to differentiate between "someone forked a book" and "someone started a new book"? Right now, there's no difference, but we may want to treat forks differently for multi-user purposes later on.

#### Bugs
- Should show the orange border as soon as something is edited in a cell, not just between eval and completion
- The counter in the client-side timeline doesn't update with newly added history states

#### Features (not necessarily in priority order)
####### Back-end
- Exports for projects, not just .lisp files (and the .lisp files should do something intelligent about the `package` forms).
	- Look into [compression options](http://www.cliki.net/compression) for the project part (it'll have to be handled as multiple files)
- Really REALLY need tags. Named checkpoints that you can jump to in book history. Implemented as part of `:fact-base`, now we need to add the proper interface here (this includes a thing for adding checkpoints, and an addition to the history slider to let it specifically jump to tagged points)
- Let user configure where to check for a `quicklisp` folder (by default, check `~/quicklisp`, `~/.cl-notebook/quicklisp` and `quicklisp` in CWD)
- Use `make-broadcast-stream` and some buffering-foo to send partial `*standard-output*` results from evaluations as they arrive. Replace them with evaluation results once those are available.
	- Suddenly more relevant because we definitely want incremental updates for proper `quicklisp` use
- Put together better storage for charts
	- Is this even possible? We could defer computation until display time, but some charts take longer to compute than I'd like. Storing the full HTML output is harder on disk use though. As in "noticeably"; the `BGG corpus charts` article weighs `80mb` on disk, and no other notebook has even cracked `2mb` yet.
- Add cell dependencies (child cells get evaluated whenever the parent is evaluated)
	- Really, what we want here is automatic resolution. When a cell is evaluated, see where its defined values are used, and re-evaluate any cells that apply.
- If there are no existing notebooks, we should write a default scratch book with some initial how-to instructions
- Get `buildapp` working properly with this
	- Give the user a one-button interaction that turns a given notebook into a binary.
- Get poor-man's profiling built into cell results (use `local-time` timestamps for start/end time of operations; compute duration)

####### Front-end
- Things I still kinda want:
	- transpose-sexp
	- slurp-sexp (forward/backward)
	- barf-sexp (forward/backward)
- Add a `run-tests` option to the main menu. Have it evaluate all test cells in the current notebook.
- Already customizing the commonlisp mode all to hell; just go the whole nine and put in the proper Lisp-specific labels instead of this `variable-3`/`string-2` shit.
- Complete on local-scope symbols (such as those introduced by `let`, `let*`, `flet`, `labels`, `macrolet`) at a higher priority than global symbols
- Handle completion and arg-hints of symbols with package names (for example, `alexandria:hash-table-alist`)
- Notebooks should be sorted by notebook-name, at the very least (in addition to the below noted fork-grouping)
	- This may involve changes to some back-end systems; you need to order up the initial notebook list, _as well as_ inserting new notebooks in an ordered manner. Do we just bite the bullet and hit the server every time? Or maybe send out a complete notebooks list every time someone adds one?
- Forked notebook entries should be grouped with their parents in the top menu. Guess you could pull out parent relationships at load-time?
- For general use, we'll want to expose customizable keybindings somehow. A session-keyed config page would work fine.

####### Multi-user related
- Move to a thread-per-cell model to make multi-user development easier
- If you join a book in the middle of an already running computation, you currently aren't notified of this. Figure something out.
- Moving cells around isn't propagated to other users
- Editing a cell should be propagated between saves (back-end should probably figure out when to save, and it should run operational transforms on diffs to keep from clobbering any users' input)
- When a notebook is forked, it should create a copy of its package for the fork to use (so that users working on different forks of the same book don't clobber each others in-image changes)
- Authentication should be a thing, and saving user preferences likewise
